Passbook Benchmarking
====================
Written for my 2A University of Waterloo Work Term Report.

The two ruby files implement compression, one uses RubyZip (https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip) and the other uses ZipRuby (https://bitbucket.org/iulianu/zip-ruby). "pass.json" and the images are compressed and the ruby benchmark module measures the time taken.

To run:
- Install Ruby 2.1.1
- run the individual files from the terminal with "ruby 'filename'"
